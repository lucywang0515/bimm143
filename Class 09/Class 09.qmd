# Intro to PDB
```{r}
df <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
df
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
(172767+14194) / 201196

```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
174825 / 201196
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

4791

# Visualizing HIV-1 Protease

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

It is only displaying the oxygen in the water molecule.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

```{r}

```

# Intro to Bio3D

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```


```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

198

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH127

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2

```{r}
attributes(pdb)

```

```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction

# Comparative Structure

> Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 

msa

> Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?: 

bio3d-view

> Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? 

TRUE


## Search and Get ADK Structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
```

```{r}
aa
```

>Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 

214

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```


```{r}
# Align rleated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```


```{r}
# Vector containing PDB codes for figure axis
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)

# Draw schematic alignment
plot(pdbs, labels=ids)
```

```{r}
anno <- pdb.annotate(ids)
unique(anno$source)
```

```{r}
anno
```

## PCA

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
# Calculate RMSD
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)

# Structure-based clustering
hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```

```{r}
#Plotting results with ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

df <- data.frame(PC1=pc.xray$z[,1], 
                 PC2=pc.xray$z[,2], 
                 col=as.factor(grps.rd),
                 ids=ids)

p <- ggplot(df) + 
  aes(PC1, PC2, col=col, label=ids) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
p
```

## Normal Model Analysis

```{r}
# NMA of all structures
modes <- nma(pdbs)
```

```{r}
plot(modes, pdbs, col=grps.rd)
```

> Q14. What do you note about this plot? Are the black and colored lines similar or different? Where do you think they differ most and why?

They are mostly similar, in trends. However, they are most different at around 120-150 residue numbers. The y-axis says there are the most fluctuations, maybe meaning it is a site high of mutation of a binding sites.
