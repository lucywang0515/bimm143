# Candy Dataset

```{r}
candy = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv", row.names=1)

head(candy)

```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

## Favorite Candy

```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Almond Joy", ]$winpercent
```

Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

### Sidenote

```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

winpercent

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

Whether the candy contains chocolate or not (how much chocolate it contains)


> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No. It is skewed to the right.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

It is below 50%.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

Chocolate is lower ranked than fruit candy.
```{r}
mean(candy$chocolate) > mean(candy$fruity)
```

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

Yes.
```{r}
t.test(candy$chocolate, candy$fruity)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(x = winpercent, y = rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()

```

#### Adding colors

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

```{r}
#Applying to ggplot
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Nik L Nip

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Reeses Peanut Butter Cup

## Money Percent

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)

```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's Miniatures.

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?


```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

## Correlation structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

`chocolate` and `fruity`

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

`chocolate` and `winpercent`

HINT: Do you like chocolaty fruity candies?
NOOOOOOO!


## PCA

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale. = TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
#Plot PC1 vs. PC2
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2])
```

```{r}
#Adding colors
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

```{r}
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p

```

```{r}
#Using `ggrepel`
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

```{r}
library(plotly)

```

```{r}
ggplotly(p)
```

```{r}
#See correlation
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

"fruity", "hard", "pluribus".It makes sense, bags of fruit hard candies are likely to be the candies people buy in Halloween.
