# Section 1. Proportion og G/G in a population (MXL)

Downloaded a CSV file from Ensemble <https://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Sample?db=core;r=17:39675097-40115098;v=rs8067378;vdb=variation;vf=105535077#373531_tablePanel>


```{r}
mxl <- read.csv("asthma.csv")
head(mxl)
```

```{r}
table(mxl$Genotype..forward.strand.)
```

```{r}
table(mxl$Genotype..forward.strand.) / nrow(mxl)
```

Read GBR asthma file and compare G/G proportion to MXL

```{r}
gbr <- read.csv("British_asthma.csv")
```

```{r}
round(table(gbr$Genotype..forward.strand.) / nrow(gbr) * 100, 2)
```

This variant that is associated with childhood asthma is more frequent in the GBR population than in the MXL population

Let's now dig into this further (why more frequent).
